    <a href="#" onclick="totalprod()" class="previous">&laquo; Previous</a>
    <a href="#" class="next">Next &raquo;</a>

    <p>
        <strong>Price per lb: </strong>The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents
        the total production of honey (dependent variable) per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors represent the
        total production per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable. Different colors were
        added to different state since its a nominal data. An annotation has been added to year 2006 when the "Colony Collapse
        Disorder" happened so that it can help visualize the trend before and after the event w.r.t. honey production. A
        line chart and not stacked line chart was used to understand the trend better per state which helps in the inference
        section. From the Total production trend line chart its very evident that the honey production of most of the states
        had a trend for reduced honey production from 1998-2012 (i.e. both before &amp; after the year 2006). This implies
        there could be another explanation to the decreased production other than the suspected "Colony Collapse Disorder"
        in 2006. Since the imports increased one potential reason could be the cost of production which may be higher domestically
        as compared to imports.

        <strong>Note: </strong>only the top 7 &amp; bottom 2 states based on total production are chosen else the charts were very
        crowded
