            <strong>Overview: </strong>The data set @ <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production/">Honey production in US</a>
            consists of honey production supply and demand in US per state between years 1998 to 2012. In the year 2006 there was decline
            in the yield due to the loss of large number of hives resulting out of a phenomenon called "Colony Collapse Disorder"
            where disappearing workers bees cause the remaining hive colony to collapse. It was speculated that the hive
            diseases and pesticides were the root cause for this. 12 years post the incidence although there is recovery
            in the honey bees and their colonies, the US honey industry is mostly struggling. US which used to produce over
            half the honey consumed per year largely depends on honey imports to meet its demands now. The data is coming
            from National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Some data cleaning was performed to get the final data
            used for the analysis.

            <ol>
                <li>Over the years 1998 to 2012 which states produced the highest and least honey?
                </li>
                <li>Was there any impact on the honey production in US post 2006 due to "Colony Collapse Disorder" in 2006?
                </li>
