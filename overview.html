        <h2>Honey production in US</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>1. Over the years 1998 to 2012 which states produced the highest and least honey? </p>

    <p>2. Was there any impact on the honey production in US post 2006 due to “Colony Collapse Disorder” in 2006? </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Overview: </strong>The following data set @
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production/" target="_blank">Honey production</a> consists of honey production supply and demand in US per state between years 1998 to 2012. In
        the year 2006 there was decline in the yield due to the loss of large number of hives resulting out of a phenomenon
        called "Colony Collapse Disorder" where disappearing workers bees cause the remaining hive colony to collapse. It
        was speculated that the hive diseases and pesticides were the root cause for this. 12 years post the incidence although
        there is recovery in the honey bees and their colonies, the US honey industry is mostly struggling. US which used
        to produce over half the honey consumed per year largely depends on honey imports to meet its demands now. The data
        is coming from National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Some data cleaning was performed to get the final
        data used for the analysis. </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Visualization: </strong>Tableau was used for the visualization. The data set consists of all states of US. These
        are the following charts that are plotted to answer the above questions. For plots 2 &amp; 3, only the top 7 &amp;
        bottom 2 states based on total production are chosen else the charts were very crowded: </p>

    <p>1. Total production: To show the states with the highest and lowest honey production from 1998-2012, a map has been used
        which provides an overview as to the relative honey production among the different states in US. The saturation as
        been used to identify the highest (ND) &amp; lowest (SC) honey production states (cumulative of 1998-2012) &amp;
        these two states have been labeled with the total production. Details for the other states will show up in tooltip.
    </p>

    <p>2. Total production trend: The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents the total
        production of honey (dependent variable) per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors represent the total production
        per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable. Different colors were added to different
        state since it’s a nominal data. An annotation has been added to year 2006 when the “Colony Collapse Disorder” happened
        so that it can help visualize the trend before and after the event w.r.t. honey production. A line chart and not
        stacked line chart was used to understand the trend better per state which helps in the inference section. </p>

    <p>3. Price per lb trend: The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents the price per
        lb (dependent variable) of honey per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors represent the price per lb per
        state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable. Different colors were added to different
        state since it’s a nominal data. </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Inference: </strong>
    </p>

    <p>1. From the Total production map, we can clearly see ND &amp; SC were the highest and lowest producer of honey cumulative
        of years 1998-2012. </p>

    <p>2. From the Total production trend line chart its very evident that the honey production of most of the states had a
        trend for reduced honey production from 1998-2012 (i.e. both before &amp; after the year 2006). This implies there
        could be another explanation to the decreased production other than the suspected “Colony Collapse Disorder” in 2006.
        Since the imports increased one potential reason could be the cost of production which may be higher domestically
        as compared to imports. To understand the impact of cost let’s look at the Price per lb trend line chart. It is evident
        that there was a gradual increase in price per lb for all states from 1998-2012. So, this corroborates that cost
        played a role in reduction of honey production. Infact one striking observation is that for states OK &amp; SC the
        price per lb increased drastically by 2003, the same year they ceased production as well.</p>
