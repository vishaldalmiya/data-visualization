    <small>
        <p>I have used interactive slideshow as the medium for the narrative visualization for dataset related to
            <b>"Honey Production in US". </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Scenes</b>: Same template has been used across all scenes (e.g. similar formatting, fonts, svg size,
                    etc). Also, D3 transitions have been deployed to make the transition smooth between scenes. There are
                    namely 4 scenes used for the interactive slide show:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Overview: </b>This scene provides an overview of what the dataset is, where it is obtained from and
                        what questions will be answered as part of this narrative visualization.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production:</b> This scene represented the cumulative honey production per state from year
                        1998-2012 to help identify the highest and lowest honey production states in US </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Total production trend:</b> This scene shows the total honey production trend across states for years
                        1998-2012
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Price per lb trend:</b> This scene shows the price per lb trend across states for years 1998-2012.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Annotations: </b>Following are the annotations that were added to therelevant slides:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production trend</b>: An annotation was added to the year 2006. This was to help the reader
                        to demarcate the trend in total production of honey before and after the year 2006 (the year of Colony
                        Collapse Disorder).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Price per lb trend: </b>When the scene transitioned from to Total production trend to Price per lb
                        trend, the previous annotation was cleared and a new one was added for the year 2003 to emphasize
                        to the readers that for states OK &amp; SC the price per lb increased drastically by 2003, the same
                        year they ceased production as well. This was done to show that price could have played a role in
                        the reduction in honey production post 2006.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Parameters:</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production:</b> To show the states with the highest and lowest honey production from 1998-2012,
                        a map has been used which provides an overview as to the relative honey production among the different
                        states in US. The saturation has been used to identify the highest (ND) &amp; lowest (SC) honey production
                        states (cumulative of 1998-2012) &amp; these two states have been labeled with the total production.
                        Details for the other states will show up in tooltip.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Total production trend</b>: The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis
                        represents the total production of honey (dependent variable) per year in lbs. Line chart with different
                        colors represent the total production per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous
                        variable. Different colors were added to different state since it’s a nominal data. A line chart
                        and not stacked line chart was used to understand the trend better per state which helps in the inference
                        section.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Price per lb trend:</b> The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents
                        the price per lb (dependent variable) of honey per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors
                        represent the price per lb per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable.
                        Different colors were added to different state since it’s a nominal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Triggers: </b>The main triggers were the "Next" and "Previous" buttons on every scene which enabled the
                    user to navigate through slides. These buttons rendered new scenes with different parameters (as described
                    in the parameters section above)
