    <small>
        <p>I have used interactive slideshow as the medium for the narrative visualization for dataset related to
            <b>"Honey Production in US". </b>
            <b>Next</b> and
            <b>Prev</b> buttons are used to navigate the slide show with options to drill down using tooltip which displays
            information about the parameters when the user hover over the data point of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Scenes</b>: Same template has been used across all scenes (e.g. similar formatting, fonts, svg size,
                    etc). There are namely 4 scenes used for the interactive slide show:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Overview: </b>This scene provides an overview of what the dataset is, where it is obtained from and
                        what questions will be answered as part of this narrative visualization.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production:</b> This scene represents the cumulative honey production per state from year 1998-2012.
                        To show the states with the highest and lowest honey production from 1998-2012, a choropleth map
                        has been used which provides an overview as to the relative honey production among the different
                        states in US. The saturation has been used to reflect the relative honey production among states
                        (cumulative of 1998-2012) &amp; only the states with highest and lowest total production have been
                        labeled with the
                        <b>state name and total production</b> to draw users attention to the same. Details for the other states
                        will show up in tooltip </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Total production trend:</b> This scene shows the total honey production trend across states for years
                        1998-2012. The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents the total
                        production of honey (dependent variable) per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors represent
                        the total production per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable.
                        Different colors were added to different state since its a nominal data. A line chart and not stacked
                        line chart was used to understand the trend better per state which helps in the inference section.
                        The years shown were in the range of 1998-2012 during which only the data was available. Legend was
                        added to identify the color code states. Only the top 7 & bottom 2 states based on total production
                        are chosen else the charts were very crowded
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Price per lb trend:</b> This scene shows the price per lb trend across states for years 1998-2012.
                        The X axis represents the year (independent variable) and the Y axis represents the price per lb
                        (dependent variable) of honey per year in lbs. Line chart with different colors represent the price
                        per lb per state. A line chart was chosen here since year is a continuous variable. Different colors
                        were added to different state since its a nominal data. The years shown were in the range of 1998-2012
                        during which only the data was available. Legend was added to identify the color code states. Only
                        the top 7 & bottom 2 states based on total production are chosen else the charts were very crowded</li>

                <li>
                    <b>Annotations: </b>Following are the annotations that were added to the relevant slides:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production: </b> The main data to highlight here were the states with highest and lowest total
                        production of honey for which the corresponding states have been marked with their state name and
                        the total production.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Total production trend: </b>An annotation was added to the year 2006. This was to help the reader
                        to demarcate the trend in total production of honey before and after the year 2006 (the year of "Colony
                        Collapse Disorder").
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Price per lb trend: </b>When the scene transitioned from to Total production trend to Price per lb
                        trend, the previous annotation was cleared and a new one was added for the year 2003 to emphasize
                        to the readers that for states
                        <b>OK</b> &amp;
                        <b>SC</b> the price per lb increased drastically by 2003, the same year they ceased production as well.
                        This was done to show that price could have played a role in the reduction in honey production post
                        2006.

                    rendered new scenes with different parameters. Examples of the same:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When the user navigates from the scene

                            <b>Total production trend</b>, using the
                            <b>Next</b> button, the maps changes to a line chart and instead of displaying the total production
                            cummulative for all years it shows total production per year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the user navigates from the scene

                            <b>Next</b> button, the
                            <b>X axis</b> remains year but
                            <b>Y axis</b> changes from total production per year per state to price per lb per year per state.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vice-versa happens for the above scenes when user clicks on
